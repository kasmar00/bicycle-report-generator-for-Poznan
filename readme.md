This script is using https://github.com/matkoniecz/bicycle_report tool to generate website describing cycling infrastructure of Krak√≥w based on OpenStreetMap data.

## Known issues

Currently it not importing the tool in a proper way (using a packaged gem). Please create issue if this bothers you (maybe because you want to reuse this code).
